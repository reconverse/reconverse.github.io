## Overview

The *reconverse* aims to provide a coherent and composable suite of analytics
tools for informing the response to disease outbreaks, health emergencies and
humanitarian crises, using the
[R software environment](https://www.r-project.org/).

We work hard to ensure packages within the *reconverse* fulfil three key goals:

- Efficiency: Packages can be used in real time to improve situation awareness
  and inform intervention strategies.
- Reliability: Packages are thoroughly and constantly tested using professional
  software development methods.
- Accessibility: Packages are free, open-source, and available on virtually any
  platform; and can be used with different levels of expertise.
