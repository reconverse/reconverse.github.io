- Efficiency: Packages can be used in real time to improve situation awareness
  and inform intervention strategies.
- Reliability: Packages are thoroughly and constantly tested using professional
  software development methods.
- Accessibility: Packages are free, open-source, and available on virtually any
  platform; and can be used with different levels of expertise.
